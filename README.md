# Descartes_underwriting

The aim of the project is to write a functional and structured code in python. Thiscode should be able to make a prediction on the dataset Auto Insurance available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/auto-insurance-fall-2017/data of target TARGET_FLAG.

This code should also explicitly return the value of the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric and generate a csv file with the predictions.

Performance is not the main goal. The objective of the project is to write the main steps of a data science project in 2 hours with a proper style and well written comments.
The code should be written in python files or ipython notebook using the appropriate libraries. We would rather have a link to a github repository
